# Image and Video Processing Final Project
 In this repository, you will see how images with gaussian noise of different noise level are denoised using a deep learning model 'DnCNN' as well as how DnCNN performs in different noise level

 The training and testing data is generated as a pickle file by running Dataset_IVP.ipynb.
